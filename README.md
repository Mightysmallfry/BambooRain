## About This
This project is meant to explore the creation of a 2d sidescroller. Then further expand upon it by exploring several skill trees. Those being:
- Occupation Skill Tree
- Combat Class Skill Tree

The Occupation Skill Tree is going to be more for exploring downtime activities or systems. ie. Cooking, Fishing, Crafting (Blacksmithing) etc. This skill tree is more about passive bonuses.

A Combat Class Skill Tree is meant for exactly that, the combat of the game. It focuses on the abilities and special moves a player can do in combat. This skill tree is more about active bonuses.

This project also include a subpixelcamera movement system. Meaning that at low speeds, camera pixel snapping should be less jarring and less noticeable.
